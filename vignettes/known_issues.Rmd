## GTFS Data for the UK

## Elevation Data

It is common for GeoTIFF to have a no data value often the maximum possible value. OTP can misinterpret this as an elevation value. So set your no data values in your elevation data to something more plausible like 0.

Note that OTP does not support all types of GeoTIFF compression so you may have to change the compression type of the image if you are experiencing problems.
