## Reasons for Routing to Fail

If you find OTP can not find a route here are some common reasons to check:

### Start or End is too far from the road network

OTP will snap fromPlace and toPlace coordinates to the road network, but only for a limited distance. If your points are far from the raod network (e.g. in a lake or middle of a park) then OTP will fail to find a route.

### Mode Specific Limits

OTP does not support all mode combinations (e.g. walk + drive) so some places may only be acessible by certain modes. For example you can't walk on a motorway or drive on a path. Use the debug layers to check for mode restrictions.

### Maximum walk to transit

by default OPT caps the maximum walking distance to a transit stop at a low level, so some areas are unreachable by transit. Increase the maximum walking distance to get better results.

### Driving on Roads with cycleway tag

Known bug that stops driving on any road with cycling infrastrucutre. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/opentripplanner-users/BOv1J32k6Sc 


## GTFS Data for the UK

Coming Soon

## Elevation Data

It is common for GeoTIFF to have a no data value often the maximum possible value. OTP can misinterpret this as an elevation value. So set your no data values in your elevation data to something more plausible like 0.

Note that OTP does not support all types of GeoTIFF compression so you may have to change the compression type of the image if you are experiencing problems.
