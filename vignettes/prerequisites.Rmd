## Introduction

This vignette is to provide guidance for people who are completely unfamiliar with Open Trip Planner and/or R.  It assumes no prior-knowledge.  If you are familiar with R and/or OTP then you may find the [Getting Started vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/opentripplanner.html) more useful.

## What is this package for, and what is a package anyway?

The Open Trip Planner for R package makes it easier for R and Open Trip Planner to communicate.

### What is Open Trip Planner?

OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is a free, open-source, and cross-platform multi-modal route planner written in JAVA.  It is like having your own private version of Google Maps.

You can find a lot more information about OTP at:

* http://www.opentripplanner.org/
* https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenTripPlanner

### What is R?

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  R has many capabilities for analysing data and writing software, but in this context, its ability to produce and analyse spatial data and maps is most relevant.

You can find a lot more information about R at:

* https://www.r-project.org/ 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) 

### What is an R package?

An R package is a small piece of software that extends the basic capabilities of R. It is a bit like how a new phone can do some things out of the box (make phone calls, send email) but you have to install apps to add extra abilities.

### Why would I want to use Open Trip Planner for R?

OTP can be used to run public route finding services such as https://ride.trimet.org but it can also be run on your own private computer or server. If you want to analyse a transport network OTP is a very useful tool. However, OTP is, as the name suggests, a Trip Planner, not analytical software.  So, while OTP can find the fastest route from A to B or find all the places that are within a 20-minute walk of C, it cannot answer a question like “how many people live within 10-minutes of a park?”  This is where R can help.  R can process multiple spatial datasets such a population densities and park locations, but does not have a built-in journey planner. 

This package allows you to use the trip planning power of OTP with the analytical might of R.

## What do I need to get started?

You will need to install some software to use OTP and R.

### To use OTP

* Download free Java 8 from https://www.java.com/en/download/ and install Java. You will need the correct version for your operating system. If possible the 64 Bit version of Java is preferable, especially if you want to use OTP over large areas.

**Note** OTP does not work with later version of Java such as Java 11.

To install Java 8 on Linux, we recommend instructions at [medium.com/coderscorner](https://medium.com/coderscorner/installing-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-16-10-845507b13343).

### To Use R

* Download free R software https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html selecting your country (or nearest available country)
* We strongly recommend you also download and install RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ that has a free version for personal use.

* On Windows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-RrkJQQYqY 

### Learning R

If you have never used R before there a lots of free tutorials to get you started, such as:

* http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction



## Next Steps

Now that you have installed Java and R go to the [Getting Started vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/opentripplanner.html), to find how to install the package, create a graph, and use it to plan trips. 
Some sample data for the Isle of Wight is provided on the GitHub page for this package https://github.com/ITSLeeds/opentripplanner/releases/tag/0.1

### Getting Data for OTP

To plan a trip OTP need data about the location, such as where the roads are, what is the public transport timetable etc.

#### Road Map Data

OTP uses road maps from the Open Street Map (OSM) https://www.openstreetmap.org in the .pbf format. OSM is a free map that anybody can edit. You can download all of part of the OSM from https://download.geofabrik.de/.

#### Public Transport Timetables

OTP can use public transport timetable data in the GFTS format. You can find GTFS data for many regions at https://transit.land/ 

#### Elevation Data

You can add terrain infromation to your routes, especially useful for walking and cycling using GeoTIFF images. You can find world wide elevation data at https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/ .
