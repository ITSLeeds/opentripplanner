## Introduction

This vignette is an introduction to OpenTripPlanner (OTP) - an open-source and cross-platform multi-modal route planner written in JAVA. It uses imported Open Street Map (OSM) data for routing on the street and path network and supports
multi-agency public transport routing through imported  [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) (GTFS) feeds. It can also apply a digital elevation model to the OSM street network, allowing, for example, cycle-friendly routes to be requested. OTP has a web front-end that can be used by end-users and a sophisticated routing API.

OTP works worldwide as long as there is OSM map coverage in the area. Support for transit timetables and elevation calculations are dependant on the available data. For more information on getting data see the [prerequisites vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/prerequisites.html)

A major advantage of running your own multi-modal route planner is the ability to carry out analysis using amended transport data. Services such as Google Maps or TransportAPI are based on current public transport schedules and the existing road network. OTP enables you to modify transit schedules and/or make changes to the underlying street network. By editing a local copy of OSM, you can model the effects of opening new roads, closing roads or imposing other restrictions. You can also look back in time. For example, you might want to examine the effect of reductions in rural bus services on the accessibility of health facilities. To do this you would need a network with bus schedules as they were in previous years.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have installed R, RStudio, and Java 8. For more details on the required software see the [prerequisites vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/prerequisites.html) included with this package.

## Installation

The following commands will install and attach the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ITSLeeds/opentripplanner")
library(opentripplanner)
```

Before you can use the package, you should set-up the OpenTripPlanner Java program.
You will need to download the latest version of OTP from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/opentripplanner/otp/ , at time of writing the latest version of OTP is version 1.3 so you would want to get https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/opentripplanner/otp/1.3.0/otp-1.3.0-shaded.jar 

The following code downloads the file into a temporary folder called `OTP` you may wish to change this to keep your results after closing R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# download file (may want to do this manually)
dir.create(file.path(tempdir(), "OTP"))
path_data <- file.path(tempdir(), "OTP")
path_otp <- file.path(path_data, "otp.jar")
u <- "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/opentripplanner/otp/1.3.0/otp-1.3.0-shaded.jar"
download.file(url = u, destfile = path_otp, mode = "wb")
```

For more information and advanced options, see http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Getting-OTP/ 

## Building an OTP Graph

We will build an example graph for the Isle of Wight using some example data provided for the package. A graph is what OTP uses to find routes, and must be built out of the raw data provided. First, we will download the sample data and put it in the folder structure that OTP expects.


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Path to the sample data
dir.create(file.path(path_data,"graphs")) # create a folder structure for the data
dir.create(file.path(path_data,"graphs","default"))
# Download example data
download.file("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/opentripplanner/releases/download/0.1/isle-of-wight-demo.zip", 
              destfile = file.path(path_data,"isle-of-wight-demo.zip") , mode="wb")
unzip(file.path(path_data,"isle-of-wight-demo.zip"), exdir = file.path(path_data,"graphs","default"))
unlink(file.path(path_data,"isle-of-wight-demo.zip"))
```

Now we can build the graph. This code will create a new file `Graph.obj` that will be saved in the location defined by `path_data`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Run the OTP and Build a graph object
log <- otp_build_graph(otp = path_otp, dir = path_data) 
```

### Building your own OTP Graph

If you want to build your own graph for a different location follow these steps, and change your `path_data` variable to the folder with your data.

An OTP graph specifies every location in the region covered and how to travel between them, and is compiled by OTP using OSM data for the street and path network (used for walk, bicycle and drive modes) and GTFS data for transit scheduling.

Our first task is to create the folder and file structure expected by OTP. This is a base directory called `otp` which contains a sub-directory called `graphs`. Directories created under `graphs` are known as OTP routers and contain all the files required to build a graph. A single OTP instance can host several routers, for example covering different regions. 

Create a router called 'default', and include the GTFS and OSM files for the road network and default transit schedules for the railway on the Isle of Wight, along with `router-config.json`, as shown below:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
/ otp                         # Your top folder for storing all OTP data
  /graphs                     
     /default                 # Subfolder with the name of the router
         osm.pbf              # Required OSM road map
         router-config.json   # Optional config file
         build-config.json    # Optional config file
         gtfs.zip             # Optional GTFS data
         dem.tif              # Optional Elevation data
         
```

`router-config.json` is actually read when the OTP server is started (in the next section), but we add it now for convenience.

## Launch OTP and load the graph

The next step is to start up your OTP server, running the router called 'default'. OTP will load the graph you created into memory and you will then be able to plan multi-modal routes using the web interface. Run the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
otp_setup(otp = path_otp, dir = path_data)
```

OTP has a built-in web server called Grizzly which runs on port 8080 (http) and 8081 (https). If you have another application running on your computer that uses these ports then you will need to specify alternative ports using the `port` and `securePort` options, for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
otp_setup(otp = path_otp, dir = path_data, port = 8801, securePort = 8802)
```

It should only take a minute or two for OTP to load the graph and start the Grizzly server. If all has worked you should see the message: `OTP is ready to use` and R will open your web browser at the OTP.

You can also access the web interface using the URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). **Note:** The web interface does not work correctly in Internet Explorer - use Firefox or Chrome. You can now zoom into the Isle of Wight area and request a route by setting an origin and a destination directly on the map (by right-clicking your mouse) and you can specify travel dates, times and modes using the 'Trip Options' window (see Figure \ref{fig:otpgui}). You can change the background map from the layer stack icon at the top right.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="\\label{fig:otpgui}OTP Web GUI"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/otpwebgui.jpg")
```


## Connecting to the OTP from R

Now you have the OTP running on your computer you can let R connect to the OTP.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
otpcon <- otp_connect()
```

The connection is created and tested, a message will be returned saying if the connection exists or not. 

If you have not used the default settings, such as a different `port` you can specify those settings in `otp_connect()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
otpcon <- otp_connect(hostname =  "localhost", router = "default", port = 8801)
```

`otp_connect()` creates an OTP connection object which will allow R to connect to the OTP. 

## Getting a route from the OTP

Now we can use R to get a route from the OTP. OTP accepts pairs of longitude/latitude coordinates for a `fromPlace` (start of the journey) and `toPlace` (end of the journey).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
route <- otp_plan(otpcon, fromPlace = c(-1.17502, 50.64590), toPlace = c(-1.15339, 50.72266))
```

If you have the `tmap` package installed you can view the route using.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("tmap") # Only needed if you don't have tmap
library(tmap)              # Load the tmap package
tmap_mode("view")          # Set tmap to interative viewing
qtm(sf::st_zm(route))      # Plot the route on a map
```

Notice the use of `sf::st_zm(route)` this is because `tmap` does not currently support XYZ coordinates.

## Stopping the OTP

As the OTP is running in Java it will continue to run after you close R.

You can stop the OTP running using the command. **NOTE: This will stop all running JAVA applications!**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
otp_stop()
```

Congratulations, you now have your own multi-modal router planner!
