OpenTripPlanner for R
=====================

The goal of OpenTripPlanner for R is to provide a simple R interface to [OpenTripPlanner (OTP)](https://www.opentripplanner.org/). The OTP is a multimodal trip planning service written in Java. For more information on what OTP is, see the [prerequisites vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/prerequisites.html).

This package can be used to interface with a remote instance of OTP (e.g. a website) or help you set up and manage a local version of OTP for private use. Basic setup and routing functions are outlined in the [getting started vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/opentripplanner.html), while advanced functionality such as batch routing, isochrones, and customised setup is described in the [advanced features vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/advanced_features.html)

Installation
------------

### OpenTripPlanner

To use OpenTripPlanner on your local computer you will need to install Java 8 and download the latest version of OTP. Instructions on installing Java and setting up OTP can be found in the [getting started vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/opentripplanner/articles/opentripplanner.html).

### R Package

Install the package with **devtools** as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools") # If you do not already have the devtools package
devtools::install_github("ITSleeds/opentripplanner")
```

Usage
-----

The package contains three groups of functions:

Functions for setting up a local instance of OTP:

1.  `otp_build_graph()` To make a OTP graph from raw data
2.  `otp_setup()` To start up a local instance of OTP

Functions for connecting to a local or remote instance of OTP:

1.  `otp_connect()` To connect to OTP

Functions for retrieving data from OTP:

1.  `otp_plan()` To get routes from A to B
2.  `otp_isochone()` To get isochrone maps
3.  `otp_geocode()` To get the locations of named places e.g. road names

Results are returned as [sf objects](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html)

Tests
-----

As this package does not work without a working connection to OTP, tests only run on machines that have the environment variable `I_have_OTP` with the value `TRUE`. You can add this with `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

``` r
Sys.getenv("I_have_OTP")
```

Package Status
